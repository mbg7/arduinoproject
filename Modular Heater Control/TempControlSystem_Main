/* ******************************************************************************
tempController.ino : This function is the setup & loop of the Temp Control System. 
1st, It calls files from DisplayFunctions.ino, HeaterControl.ino, and SetTemp.
2nd, prompts the user to adjust the set point of the temperature controller. 
3rd, uses a PID control system to reach and maintain the set temperature in the output.
If the maxTemp is exceeded, the screen locks out with a warning and the output 
    is locked to off position, with the PID blocked off.  To recover from an 
    overTempAlarm state, the user must reset the controller.
Future functionality: 
      (1) Improve PID using AutoTune
      (2) Set alarm lock if the heater has beeen on for too long 
          > because if physical thermocouple fails, currentTemp is unreliable.
      (3) Other safety features
